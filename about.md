## Work Experience


### Research Intern @[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in)
**Nov 2023 - Feb 2024 | Coimbatore, India**
For my master thesis, I wanted to work on something valuable and futuristic. Looking at the research landscape revealed the importance of verification and validation in safety critical systems. Autonomous vehicles have had tremendous advancements thanks to improvements in AI for which verification and validation methods are not yet completely developed. So I decided to pursue this topic in collaboration with the Software Defined Vehicles (SDV) team at Thoughtworks at Coimbatore. The SDV team were already working on interesting projects towards the software defined vehicles trend and we had shared interest towards my thesis topic. At the end of my internship I had developed a framework that will formally verify the functional properties of an object detection module used in autonomous vehicles.

### Robotics Engineer @[Corning Inc](https://www.corning.com/emea/de.html)
**Dec 2021 - July 2022 | Berlin, Germany**

I joined Corning as a working student during my masters course at the Technical University of Berlin. I joined a 5 people team working on automating an assembly process for one of their products used in optical fibre communication. It involved picking small optical filters of size ~1mm and glueing them on to a base in some orientation. The orientation of the filters should be calculated before fixing them and it depends upon the type of the product specifications and the type of filter used. Manual assembly consumed lot of time and led to reworks due to errors in the process. The idea was to setup robotic cells with a small industrial manipulator and all necessary instruments. The robot takes of the whole process from picking up the filters, taking it to different stations for cleaning, calculating the orientation, dispensing glue and then fixing them onto modules with certain orientation.

The robot was equipped with camera and a laser based height measurement sensor. My contributions were towards the perception and path planning functionalities of the robot. I improved the vision algorithm to accuratley dispense glue onto the filter and implemented path planning using ROS. Finally, I developed an UI for non-technical people to easily control the entire assembly process. The project was deployed at one of the manufacturing facilities located in Mexico for testing.
