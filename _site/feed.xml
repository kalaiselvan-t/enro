</ul>

<p>Let me start by asking you this question. Do you know if the neural network you developed work as you intended? You might have used a verification dataset to check if your model has generalized well to unseen data. But is that enough to know if the neural network’s functionality is correct. What if the network is going to be deployed in a safety ctitical system like autonomous cars? It is absolutely necessary to make sure that they have correct functionality before we can deploy such systems. What can we do to make sure our network doesn’t exhibit any unintended behaviours after deployment.</p>

<p>Automotive industry is very well regulated by both the government and industry consortiums. It follows the V-model development cycle for its systems development. One of the important processes</p>

<h2 id="what-is-verification-and-validation">What is Verification and Validation?</h2>

<p>This is done by a process called verification and validation.</p>
