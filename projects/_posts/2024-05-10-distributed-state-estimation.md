## Distributed State Estimation Using Kalman-Consensus Filter

Object tracking is a very common need in multiple sectors for multiple reasons. Industrial areas have huge spaces and tracking an object within them is a difficult task. One reason is that a single sensor doesn't have enough range to cover the entire space of the environement. So, we have to rely on multiple sensors to get the job done. The goal of this project is to track an object through a huge space. We assume that the environment is sufficiently equipped with multiple sensors for our needs. We may use distributed state estimation techniques for this purpose.
